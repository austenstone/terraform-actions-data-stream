# terraform-actions-data-stream

Terraform for the cloud-side resources that GitHub Actions Data Stream writes to.

Actions Data Stream pushes workflow and job telemetry from GitHub to a sink you own. It
authenticates with OIDC, so there are no keys or secrets to store anywhere. The tradeoff is that
the trust relationship has to be set up exactly right on your side before anything works. That
setup is what these modules do.

> [!NOTE]
> Actions Data Stream is in preview. Availability depends on your plan and feature enablement.

## What gets created

| Module | Creates |
|---|---|
| [`modules/azure-identity`](modules/azure-identity) | User-assigned managed identity + federated credential. Used by the other Azure modules. |
| [`modules/azure-blob`](modules/azure-blob) | Storage account, container, `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role assignment. |
| [`modules/azure-kusto`](modules/azure-kusto) | Kusto cluster, database, table + ingestion mapping, `Ingestor` role assignment. |
| [`modules/aws-s3`](modules/aws-s3) | OIDC provider, IAM role with a scoped trust policy, S3 bucket, write policy. |

Each module outputs a `sink_config` object you paste straight into the data stream configuration.

## The part everyone gets wrong

The subject claim. It is:

```
actions-data-stream:organization/<numeric-org-id>
```

Two things trip people up:

1. It is **not** the same subject format as regular Actions OIDC (`repo:owner/name:ref`). A trust
   policy you already have for `actions/deploy` will not work here.
2. It is the **numeric** ID, not the slug. `actions-data-stream:organization/octodemo` is wrong.

Get yours from the data stream UI, or:

```bash
gh api /orgs/YOUR_ORG --jq .id
```

Enterprises use `actions-data-stream:enterprise/<numeric-enterprise-id>`.

The audience is `api://AzureADTokenExchange` on Azure and `sts.amazonaws.com` on AWS. The issuer is
`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` on both. All three are set for you by these modules.

## Quick start

### Azure Blob

Cheapest option and the fastest way to prove the OIDC chain works end to end.

```bash
cd examples/azure-blob
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # then edit it
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)

```bash
cd examples/azure-kusto
terraform init
terraform apply
```

> [!WARNING]
> Even the `Dev(No SLA)` SKU bills roughly $100/month while the cluster is running. Destroy it when
> you are done, or set `auto_stop_enabled`.

The module creates the table and the JSON ingestion mapping for you, with columns matching the event
envelope:

| Column | Type |
|---|---|
| `eventUuid` | `string` |
| `eventType` | `string` |
| `eventTimestamp` | `datetime` |
| `enterpriseId` | `long` |
| `organizationId` | `long` |
| `eventData` | `dynamic` |

`eventData` is `dynamic` because its shape differs per event type.

### AWS S3

```bash
cd examples/aws-s3
terraform init
terraform apply
```

If your account already has the GitHub OIDC provider (likely, since regular Actions OIDC uses the
same one), set `create_oidc_provider = false`.

## Verify before you commit to it

Once `terraform apply` finishes, validate the trust relationship. This performs the real token
exchange against your identity provider and returns the raw error if anything is wrong. It creates
nothing.

```bash
terraform output -json sink_config \
  | jq '{name: "test", sink_type: "azure_blob", config: .}' \
  | gh api -X POST /orgs/YOUR_ORG/actions/data-stream/sinks/test-connection --input -
```

A `success: true` means GitHub can authenticate and write. Anything else comes back with the
provider's own error message, which is usually enough to identify the problem.

Common failures:

| Error contains | Cause |
|---|---|
| `AADSTS70021` | Subject claim mismatch. Check the numeric ID and the `organization` vs `enterprise` prefix. |
| `AADSTS700213` | Audience mismatch. Should be `api://AzureADTokenExchange`. |
| `403` / `AuthorizationPermissionMismatch` | Identity authenticated but lacks the data-plane role. Control-plane Contributor is not enough. |
| `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` | AWS trust policy condition does not match the subject. |

Role assignments can take a minute or two to propagate. If auth succeeds but writes fail, wait and
retry before changing anything.

## Events

Five event types are streamed:

- `workflow_run_created`
- `workflow_run_completed`
- `workflow_job_created`
- `workflow_job_completed`
- `actions_resolved` — the requested action name and version alongside the **resolved SHA**, which is
  what makes supply-chain auditing possible

Delivery is at-least-once with no ordering guarantee, so deduplicate on `eventUuid` and sort on
`eventTimestamp` rather than assuming arrival order.

Payloads are newline-delimited JSON. Blob and S3 write one object per batch.

## Cleanup

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Delete the sink in GitHub first, otherwise it will keep retrying against resources that no longer
exist.
